   <h3> Apple's macOS, successor to the popular OS X operating system, runs on Apple laptops and desktops.<br> Based in part on the historic family of Unix operating systems dating back to research in the 1960s at AT&T's Bell Labs, macOS shares some features with other Unix-related operating systems including Linux.<br> While the graphical interfaces are different, many of the underlying programming interfaces and command line features are the same.<br>
Signature elements of macOS include the dock used to find programs and frequently used files, unique keyboard keys including the Command key, and the stoplight-colored buttons used to resize open program windows.<br> MacOS is known for its user-friendly features, which include Siri, a natural-voice personal assistant, and FaceTime, Apple's video-calling application.</h3>
