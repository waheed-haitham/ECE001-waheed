  <h3><p>Microsoft Windows has existed in one form or another since 1985, and it remains the most popular operating system for home and office computers.<br> Its latest versions, including Windows 10, are also used on some tablets, and the OS is used on some web and number-crunching server computers as well.<br> Computers from a wide variety of manufacturers can use Windows.<br>

Initial versions of Windows worked with an earlier Microsoft operating system called MS-DOS, providing a modern graphical interface on top of DOS's traditional text-based commands.<br> Signature features of Microsoft Windows's user interface include windows themselves â€“ rectangle-shaped, on-panel screens that represent individual applications.<br> The Windows Start menu has helped generations of users find programs and files on their devices.<br>

Efforts to use versions of the Windows OS for smartphones have been less successful.</p></h3>
