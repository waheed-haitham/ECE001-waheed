 <p>Unlike many other operating systems, development on Linux isn't led by any one company.<br> 
The operating system was created by Finnish programmer Linus Torvalds in 1991.<br> Nowadays, programmers from all over the world collaborate on its open source code and submit tweaks to the central kernel software and other programs.<br>

A wide assortment of commercial and open source software is available for Linux, and various Linux distributions provide custom user interfaces and tools for installing<br> software onto machines running the operating system.<br>
A favorite of many programmers, Linux is widely used on corporate and scientific servers, including cloud computing environments.<br> 
Linux can be run on a wide variety of hardware and is available free of charge over the internet.</p>
