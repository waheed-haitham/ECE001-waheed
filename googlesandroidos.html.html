  <h3> <P> Android is the most popular operating system in the world judging by the number of devices installed.<br> Largely developed by Google, it's chiefly used on smartphones and tablets.<br> Unlike iOS, it can be used on devices made by a variety of different manufacturers, and those makers can tweak parts of its interface to suit their own needs.<br>

Users can download custom versions of the operating system because large portions of it are open source, meaning anyone can legally modify it and publish their own.<br> However, most people prefer to stick with the version that comes on their devices.<br>

Android, like iOS, comes with an application and media store called the Play Store built by Google.<br> Some phone manufacturers and other organizations also offer their own stores to install software and media.</P></h3>
